<h3>
  Who is "we"?:
</h3>

<p>
  A Moonlit Cafe Press is a tiny DIY art project run by one small bat, Nicks
  Walker. I am a white, trans, queer and disabled/neurodivergent - and if me
  listing these things puts you off, we probably won't make the most sense as
  art collaborators!
</p>

<p>
  I cannot emphasise enough that I am Not Proper. This project is influenced by
  queer punks and library printers. Come to me if you like the idea of someone
  printing your words out, because you have some words to get out there. Handing
  out
  paper bags of zines at a weird party. That's what I'm going for.
</p>

<h3>
  What is "open for submissions"?:
</h3>

<p>
  For the second time, I'm planning to print up to five tiny chapbooks. These will be:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A6 booklets, 10-20 pages long
  <li>Courier New (when printed)
  <li>Sold in a group only!
</ul>

<p>
  In the past I've accepted NSFW material, trauma content, dream prose, teeth poetics, and even traditional verse. I'm
  up for anything offered in good faith, and not coming from a discriminatory place. Genre art is VERY WELCOME. I would
  print your Doctor Who story if a representative of the BBC didn't live in my walls.
</p>

<p>
  I can open most forms of word processing, and will let you know if I can't open your file. Black and white very-hybrid
  work and visual poetry will be considered, but one of the considerations will be if I can do meaningful justice to
  your work. Internal printing in colour is sadly beyond my budget.
</p>

<p>
  As a tiny hobby press I run at a loss, so contributors will be paid in a one-off Â£30 fee of thanks for their work.
</p>

<h3>
  What is "sold in a group"??
</h3>

<p>
  These are party bags of words! An experiment in found galleries. An anthology
  where you get a personalised front cover and ISBN number. (Check out our SHOP
  for more info!)
</p>

<p>
  The group distribution thing is a big part of the project for me.
</p>

<p>
  I'm really looking for folk who are into this idea too, and up for exploring
  it. Ideally although these are discrete chapbooks, you'd submit something
  you'd be happy to see placed in an anthology with other work.
</p>

<p>
  Do note that other work might be NSFW! If you have any hard limit
  themes/topics you would not be comfortable with your work being paired with,
  do feel free to let me know in your submission email. If we need to chat more
  about that, we absolutely can.
</p>

<h3>
  Do you have even more caveats somehow??
</h3>

<p>
  Yes, I do! I'm based in THE UK. This isn't great for anyone really, including
  me! International distribution is expensive right now. I'm very happy to work
  with folk across any of the various oceans (and send across bundles of
  bundles), but if you want easy local access to your work, a small UK-based DIY
  printer may not be for you.
</p>

<p>
  Okay, I get it, where's the bloody email?
</p>

<p>
  Here (!!): <a href="mailto:amoonlitcafepress@gmail.com">amoonlitcafepress@gmail.com</a>
</p>

<h3>
  And does my email need to be any particular way?
</h3>

<p>
  Not really.
</p>

<h3>
  How about an author bio?
</h3>

<p>
  That'd be grand, but honestly write anything that gives a flavour of who you
  are and why you're up for this.
</p>

<p>
  Cheers.
</p>

<p>
  Thanks, me.
</p>

<p>
  It's over now.
</p>

<p>
  Cheerio.
</p>

<p>
  Bye.
</p>
